Hint
=======

To complete your firs golang program, create a new file with a `.go` extension and start
writing Go code. Execute your program by running it with the `go` command, if the name of
the file is `main.go`. e.g.:

```shell
$ go run main.go
```

When you are done, you must run:

```shell
$ learnyougo verify main.go
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will
be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
